THE JAVA PROJECT
------------
With particular interest, this repository contains folders with files that contain  java code.
It will  help guide a beginner in a practical way and for an experienced programmer, it can offer quick revision of one or two concepts up the tree.
Refer to the README file if a folder contains one because the file explains the code and does cover up for the most of the comments.
But !!! comments specific to the code are kept in the appropriate positions within the source files.
Yay :) lets get it done buddy.
