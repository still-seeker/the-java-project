In this folder is an introduction to java comments
comments in java are lines that are ignored by the compiler
To mark a statement as a comment, it must be preceeded by some symbols.

A single line comment has two forward slashes(//) at the beginning of the line.
A multi-line comment is enclosed between /* comment here */
A javadoc comment will be covered at a later stage.
